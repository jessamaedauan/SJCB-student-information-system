REQUIREMENTS: Node.js (LTS) installed.

RUN THE BACKEND
1. Open a terminal in VS Code.
2. Run:
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start

2. Run:
   cd frontend
   npm install

IMPROVEMENTS
- All five program cards are clickable and open a program/event hub.
- Upload event title, date, description, and image for CICS, CCJE, CAS, CBM, or CTE.
- Uploaded event images are stored in backend/uploads and event details in backend/events.json.
- Dashboard and event feed refresh automatically about every 10 seconds for new posts.
- Search students by name, student ID, email, course, or program without needing to open the student's program first.
- Fifth Year option removed; year levels are 1st through 4th Year.
- Student records retain Add/Edit/Delete functionality and are stored in backend/students.json.
- Dark theme with green accents and orange glow.

LOGOS
The provided logos are in frontend/public/images. The CTE logo has not yet been supplied, so the CTE card temporarily uses the Saint Joseph College logo. When you send the official CTE logo, save it as frontend/public/images/cte-logo.png (or .jfif) and update the CTE logo path in frontend/src/App.jsx.
Event uploads require the backend to be running. Supported images: JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF; maximum 8 MB each.


PRELOADED EVENT
- CAS Dance Duo Competition Champions — Intramurals 2026. Two provided event images are stored in backend/uploads and displayed in the event feed. Exact event date/time was not provided, so the entry clearly says exact date not provided.
- The provided College of Teacher Education (CTE) logo is stored at frontend/public/images/cte-logo.jfif.


LATEST EVENT UPDATE
Added CCJE event posts for the COQC Pinning of Ranks and Closing Ceremony (SY 2025–2026), with both user-provided photos. Exact ceremony date was not provided.

Added CBM event: BSBA and BSTM Students Prepare for the Season of Creation, including the supplied garden activity photo. Exact event date was not provided.
